# camerawl
A project to automate the download, backup, naming of digital photos. The name comes from the Bristolian word for Camera :)

## Hardware requirements
A raspberry pi (built and tested on a v4b 8gb), will probably work fine on others.

## Software requirements
Currently using Ubuntu as the base OS becuase it runs. Expect this to change when I have time to test.
