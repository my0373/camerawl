# camerawl
A project to automate the download, backup, naming of digital photos. The name comes from the Bristolian word for Camera :)

## Git branches
The latest version of all code is stored in the "latest" branch. It's where working code should end up.

Why not use "master" ? Well, my personal choice is not to use the term master as it's just a label, and one i'd rather avoid.

## Hardware requirements
A raspberry pi (built and tested on a v4b 8gb), will probably work fine on others.

## Software requirements
Currently using Ubuntu as the base OS becuase it runs. Expect this to change when I have time to test.

# Project progress
